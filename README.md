# After-me-starter-app

This repository is currently a minimal starter. The workspace now contains a small Node.js scaffold (source, tests, and CI) intended as a lightweight baseline.

Quick start

Install dependencies (optional locally):

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app:

```bash
npm start
# or
node src/index.js YourName
```

Run tests (no external test framework required):

```bash
npm test
```

If you'd prefer a different language/runtime, tell me which one and any preferences (test framework, CI), and I'll scaffold it.
